<h1>Pop Left</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p align="Justify">In this subsection, we want to the remove the left most node from the list, and to do so, we need to understand that we cant just remove the head from the list. We have to assign the head to the next node and then disconnect previous node from the newly assigned head. Now the node can be removed from the list. </p>

<p>Notes</p>

 - The Time Complexity and Space Complexity is O(1)
