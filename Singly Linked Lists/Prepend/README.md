<h1>Prepend</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This subsection will focus on the prepend function that will add a node to front of the head node in a list. This will make the new prepended node the head node of the list.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

 - The Time Complexity of prepend is very similar to append as it is just moving to the previous node. So this is O(1)
 - The Space Complexity is the same because append because the only thing changing is the size of the list. So this is also O(1)
