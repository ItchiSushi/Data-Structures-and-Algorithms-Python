<h1>Singly Linked Lists</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

 - Dynamic Arrays require memory reallocation
 - Static Arrays requires us to know the size of the array when defining it. This can be problematic because we don't know how many elements we'll end up having.
 - Adding and removing items from the beginning or from inside the array is expensive.

<h3>Linked Lists</h3>

<p>In a linked list, each element will have its own container, and each element will have a connection to the next one after it. Each element will only have one link to the next element.</p>
