<h1>Singly Linked Lists</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

 - Dynamic Arrays require memory reallocation
 - Static Arrays requires us to know the size of the array when defining it. This can be problematic because we don't know how many elements we'll end up having.
 - Adding and removing items from the beginning or from inside the array is expensive.

<h3>Linked Lists</h3>

<p>In a linked list, each element will have its own container, and each element will have a connection to the next one after it. Each element will only have one link to the next element.</p>

 - There is a head and tail node in every list with the head being the first element that points to the next element, and the tail being the last element that points to nothing.
 - We have to keep track of what's in between the two nodes.

 - Append
 - Prepend
 - Pop Left
