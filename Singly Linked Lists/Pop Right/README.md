<h1>Pop Right</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p align="justify">This function focuses on removing an element to the right most side of the list. This Tail node is assigned to the previous node and the last node is disconnected and removed.</p>

- Time complexity for this is O(n) because it uses a for loop to cycle through the entire list to find the node before the tail node. This is not beneficial for large lists
- The Space complexity is O(1) as memory is decreasing as elements are removed from the list.
