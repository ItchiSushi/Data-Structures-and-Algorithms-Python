<h1>Append</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p align="Justify">This subsection will focus on writing efficient code to append an array with Head and Tail nodes in a Singly Linked List.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

 - The time complexity of the append function is O(1) because there is only one function being used continuously to append a new node to the list.
 - The Space complexity is O(1) because the function will always behave the same way regardless of the size of the list.
