<h1>Recursion vs Iteration</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Finding the product of all the numbers in an array</p>

<b>When to use what?
- In most languages iteration is faster recursion requires call-stack management.
- Recursion can use more memory because of all the stack frames.
- Some languages optimize recursive calls.
- Recursion usually has the advantage in code simplicity manual management of a stack in iteration can be error-prone.
- It all depends.
