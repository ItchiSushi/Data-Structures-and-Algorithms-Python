<h1>Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p align = "justify">In this repository, I would like to showcase my comprehensive understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. I am currently following a 11 hours and 30 minutes in-depth training course on DSA vusing Udemy.</p>

<h2>What I Know About DSA</h2>

<b>Algorithms</b>

<p align = "justify">Algorithms are a well-defined sequence of steps that take one or more values as inputs and produce one or more values as outputs.</p>

<b>What Makes a Good Algorithm?</b>
  -	It's finite
  -	Correct result every time
  -	It's efficient

<b>Problem solving approach:</b>
  - Understand the problem
  - Gather all the information you have
  - Write some code, test, refactor

<b>Data Structures</b>

<p>It is a collection of values, the relationships between them, and the operations that can be applied to them.</p>

<b>Data Structures Specialize in:</b>
  - Retrieving the large value from a collection
  - Instant access to elements
  - Representing hierarchy
  - Allowing efficient operations on both ends
  - Describing behavior

<b>Why Should I Bother with This?</b>
  - They’re everywhere
  - Efficiency
  - They’ll help me write better code
