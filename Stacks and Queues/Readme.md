<h1>Stacks and Queues</h1>

<h2>Stacks</h2>

<p>Stacks follows a Last In, First Out (LIFO). Meaning that the last element that gets added to the list will be the first to be removed. Stacks follows a push and pop method from the top of the stack.</p>

- This is a O(n) Complexity for the array implementation because you can only add and remove at the end of the list.
