<h1>Space Complexity</h1>

<h2> Auxiliary space complexity</h2>

<p align = "justify">The memory an algorithm needs to run, without counting the memory needed to store the input. 
The space complexity of O(n)  is O(n) because thereâ€™s only one variable used to iterate through an entire list.
When creating new data inside an algorithm we need to think about the auxiliary memory utilization.
