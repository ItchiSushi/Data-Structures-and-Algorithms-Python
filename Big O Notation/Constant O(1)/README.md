<h1>Constant Time</h1>

<b>Operations with Constant Complexity:</b>
  - Performs simple variable assignments
  - Performs arithmetic operations and comparisons
  - Can reference to a specific memory location (accessing elements in a list by index or in a dictionary by key)

<p>O(1) algorithms take the same amount of effort to run, regardless of the input size</p>
