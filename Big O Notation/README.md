<h1>Big O Notation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p align = "justify">In this section I want to cover everything that is Big O. From Constant O(1) to Logarithmic O(logn). I would also like to show my understanding of Space and Asymptotic Complexity.</p>

<h3>Big O Notation</h3>
<b>Can be Written as: O(n)</b>

  - O(n)^2
  - O(n)
  - O(1)

<p align = "justify">Computational complexity measures the number of resources an algorithm requires to run. In theory, “Big O” is the most used notation.</p>
