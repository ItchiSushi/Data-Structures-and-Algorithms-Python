<h1>O(n) Linear Time</h1>

<p algin = "justify">O(n) complexity indicates that the effort to run an algorithm grows proportionally to the number of items being processed. This can be represented using a for loop or a while loop.</p>

  - Itâ€™s easier to determine the rate of growth because we can check if we iterate through the entire list.
  - With While Loop, we have to assess when the condition to stop will be met and estimate how many iterations we do compared to the size of the input.
