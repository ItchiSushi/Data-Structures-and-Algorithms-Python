<h1>O(logn) Logarithmic Time</h1>

<h2>Logarithms</h2>
<p align = "justify">The logarithm is the inverse of the mathematical operation of exponentiation. This indicates the number of steps taken to find the target value. An example is a using the binary search algorithm.</p>

- If we used O(n) algorithm to find the number 80 in a list of 99 values, then it would take 80 steps or O(n) 80.
- But if we used O(logn) to perform the same operation, it would take 7 steps or O(logn) 7. O(logn) is the second best to O(1), however, it has more applicability.
- It is also extremely good to use for large datasets.
