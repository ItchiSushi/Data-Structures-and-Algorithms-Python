<h1>Asymptotic Complexity</h1>

<p>Given the example:O(n^2  50n 1000)</p>

<p>The asymptotic complexity is O(n^2) because n^2 has a far greater output compared to the other terms.</p>

<h2>Summary of Finding the Complexity of an Algorithm</h2>

 - Simple variable assignments, arithmetic operations, and comparisons are usually constant time operations
 - Simple loops over the input are running in linear time.
 - Nested loops over the input are running in quadratic time
 - Logarithmic time happens when disregarding large parts of the input with each loop.
